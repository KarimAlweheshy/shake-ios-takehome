Takeoff Labs Shake Exercise

This is a frontend exercise that will give you the chance to see what kind of things we build at Takeoff Labs!

You will be building a simplified version of the instagram stories, very similar to Instagram. 
The app will display a horizontal list of users who have posted some stories, you can click on it to see the stories and navigate between them.

We've provided the design and an explanation of each component in a Figma file - https://www.figma.com/file/aBSmzbQ9dQDlEfriXGA1wJ/Stories-take-home?node-id=7%3A147.

Your goal is to make as much progress on this project in the time allocated.

## Getting started
  
Run the following commands:

```
cd Shake-Starter-Pack/
open Shake.xcodeproj
```

The starter project already contains the "business" / "data" part, the REST API request is already implemented and the objects are already serialized. Ready to be used in your UI :)
